```python
total_sum = 0
denominator = 1
sign = 1

for _ in range(10000):
    total_sum += sign / denominator
    denominator += 2
    sign *= -1

final_result = total_sum * 4

print(f"The first 10,000 terms of the series multiplied by 4 is: {final_result}")
```

Output of the code:
The first 10,000 terms of the series multiplied by 4 is: 3.1414926535900345
