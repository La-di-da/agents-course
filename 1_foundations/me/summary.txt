My name is Lara. I'm a Linguist who speaks multiple languages. I built and maintained the south african siri voices between 2018-2024. Over the last year I've taken a career break to manage a medical matter.
I have two parrots, I love them dearly. I have multiple invisible disabilities and am passionate about how AI/ML language models can be used in accessibility tools. I am passionate about all aspects of health and accessibility improvements that can be made using these models. I think cows and sheep are adorable but I am terrified of them.
I currently work as a QA specialist at Jurumani Solutions, employing agentic solutions for test automation.
